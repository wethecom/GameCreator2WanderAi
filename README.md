# Game Creator 2 Wander Ai
this progect is dead as it dosnt wander in a desirable way.. there are usfful things
in this code like waypoint marker editing and gizmos 

Unity Game Creator 2 Wander Ai follows prefered paths randomly
like walk main paths in a building or general walk sidewalks

bug fixes.. add the waypoint script back to the waypoints missing script...
the camera is missing a script didnt seem to matter.
add a navmesh make all the geomatry a child.

I added images to show you a working setup of all the insrtuction
